### Summary
Spotify Wrapped + is a web app that allows the user to visualize their Spotify listening habits. The code for it can be found here: {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://github.com/jeffreyjsung/spotify-wrapped-plus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/jeffreyjsung/spotify-wrapped-plus</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. This is unfortunately not hosted anywhere at the moment because Spotify only lets explictly added users to access third-party apps.

This project was created with a React frontend and Node.js backend. I used the Spotify Web API to obtain profile data and then manipulated/used it to display in a visually appealing manner.

Inside the app, you can do things such as: view your most listened to artists, see your recently played tracks + how long ago you were listening, and even sort your playlists by certain audio features!
