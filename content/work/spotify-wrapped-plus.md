### Summary
Spotify Wrapped + is a web app that allows the user to visualize their Spotify listening habits. It is hosted here: {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://spotify-wrapped.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://spotify-wrapped.herokuapp.com/</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. Unfortunately, Spotify only lets explictly added users to access third-party apps, but if you would like to try it out yourself feel free to contact me!

This project was created with a React frontend and Node.js backend. I used the Spotify Web API to obtain profile data and then manipulated/used it to display in a visually appealing manner.

Inside the app, you can do things such as: view your most listened to artists, see your recently played tracks + how long ago you were listening, and even sort your playlists by certain audio features!
