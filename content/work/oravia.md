### Summary
A side-scrolling game (think Mario, Sonic, etc.) that several other students and I designed and put together. It is 2.5D, which means the assets are rendered in 3D, but the movement is not actually 3-dimensional. Built using the Unity Game Engine, all assets were created by us.

### My Contributions
- Formulated core level design
- Scripted enemy AI movement and attack patterns
- Camera behavior
- Character control systems
