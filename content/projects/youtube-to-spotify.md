### Summary
I found myself discovering a lot of music through YouTube, but I prefer to use Spotify for regularly listening to music (I have Spotify Premium). This a simple command line tool that will allow you to log in to both services and transfer music saved in a YouTube playlist into a new or existing Spotify playlist. This way, you don't have to keep manually searching up and adding stuff.
