## Summary
A simple tool that measures your typing speed. Basically the same as {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://play.typeracer.com/" target="_blank">TypeRacer</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} if you are familiar with that, except it comes with the option to have autocorrect on. 

The finished product can be interacted with at {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://cats.cs61a.org/" target="_blank">cats.cs61a.org</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}.
