Hey there, I'm Jeffrey!   


I'm currently an undergraduate student studying at UC Berkeley.
Welcome to my spot on the web for the projects I've created - a compendium of the things I've learned over the years. 
I really love building things â€” mostly software, but have also delved into the world of hardware. I'm still discovering new things within the field of technology and on a mission to learn it all, from computer architecture to machine learning.
