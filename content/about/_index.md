Hey there, I'm Jeffrey!   


I'm currently an undergraduate student studying at UC Berkeley.
Welcome to my spot on the web for the projects I've created - a compendium of the things I've learned over the years. 
I'm still discovering new things within the field of technology and on a mission to learn it all, from computer architecture to machine learning.

A list of upper-division courses I have taken:  
Digital Design and Integrated Circuits (EECS151)  
Computer Security (CS161)  
Algorithms (CS170)  
Database Systems (CS186)  
Artificial Intelligence (CS188)  
Machine Learning (CS189)  
Principles and Techniques of Data Science (DATA100)  
Probability for Data Science (DATA140)  
Nonlinear and Discrete Optimization (IEOR160)  
Linear Programming and Network Flows (IEOR162)
