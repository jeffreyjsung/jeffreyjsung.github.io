>## Relevant Coursework
Here I am going to talk briefly about the upper-division courses I have taken at UC Berkeley and my honest thoughts on them, for any students (or others) who are curious. I tried to take courses on a variety of topics instead of specializing in one area.
#### DATA 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science
A very "applied" course - it is extremely useful to know how to visualize and interpret data. Also a very basic overview of some machine learning concepts, but the biggest takeaway from this course was the former.
#### DATA 140: Probability for Data Science
This course was actually very good material-wise and has a pretty great textbook. It allowed me to understand the probability that popped up in CS 189 very easily. Definitely not a walk in the park, though. You're expected to work through and derive a lot of things on your own. I learned much more taking this than I ever did in CS 70.
#### IEOR 160: Nonlinear and Discrete Optimization
A decent introduction to optimization. Not nearly as in depth as EECS 127 would be, but I think it's just enough to understand how it ties in with machine learning, which was basically my reason for taking it.
#### IEOR 162: Linear Programming and Network Flows
Sorry, but my experience with this course wasn't that great. It's just not very interesting in my opinion and much of the homework is just tedious instead of reinforcing any real concepts. The lectures just kind of tell you to "do this, do that" without any explanation of why. CS 170 covers linear programming and network flows briefly, and honestly I got more out of that than from this course.
#### CS 161: Computer Security
I really enjoyed this course. It isn't overly difficult for the sake of being difficult and had fun, open-ended projects. It is also one of the few classes which actually teaches you about networking and the Internet, which (ironically) is a topic that is seldom formally covered in UC Berkeley CS courses, even though it would seem foundational in a computer science curriculum.
#### CS 170: Algorithms
A lot of people say this course is extremely difficult, but I found it to be easier than CS 70 (lower division Discrete Math/Probability course). It's still a difficult course, but it actually tests your ability to reason through things rather than your "math skills" (\*cough\*CS 70\*cough\*). This course really made me look at problem solving differently and overall is a great class. 
#### CS 186: Database Systems
I thought I would enjoy this course more, but it is pretty dull, I'm not going to lie. You'd have to be really passionate about disk latency for some reason to enjoy this course. At a high level the topics are somewhat interesting, but too much of the course revolves around tediously calculating I/Os in my opinion. The projects are in Java and relatively straightforward.
#### CS 188: Artificial Intelligence
This course is pretty overrated, in my opinion. Exams were extremely difficult and confusing for no reason other than to lower the curve. Projects were kind of cool but honestly didn't really require much thinking (basically fill-in-the-blank Python). I didn't feel like I really gained any useful knowledge coming out of this class.
#### CS 189: Machine Learning
Don't expect to succeed in this course without a significant amount of prior preparation/knowledge. Do not even attempt this course if you are not very familiar with probability and doing abstract math in higher dimensions. A lot of it is really just understanding the mathematical concepts and jargon that is constantly thrown around. The rest is figuring out how to debug NumPy code (really annoying, in my opinion :upside_down_face:). The material itself is interesting, but without the correct background you'll just be struggling through the math instead of really learning anything. I took DATA 140 and IEOR 160 beforehand, and they were helpful, but a little more practice doing symbolic linear algebra and vector calculus would have been nice. Again, a conceptually difficult course, but definitely one worth taking.
