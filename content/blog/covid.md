Our main goals were to see if the COVID-19 mortality rate could be well predicted given the public data and if there is a critical point in vaccination rates that causes the biggest change in COVID-19 infections and deaths.

### Summary
- Cleaned and organized COVID-19 data from multiple sources using pandas
- Used PCA to visualize spatial relationships between COVID-19 cases and mask usage
- Trained several different linear regression models to predict new COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Tried different methods for predicting a single day ahead and multiple days ahead
