### Summary
I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern under the Profiles Team at Amazon, also collaborating closely with the Core Recommendations Team. My project involved delivering a personalized recommendation widget that will be displayed on the Amazon retail website. I worked on both client-side and server-side software.

What I did:  
- Built an algorithm to efficiently retrieve and process browsing history data for specific users (for feeding into recommendation system)
- Developed a strategy that uses the retrieved data and collaborative filtering to generate new, high quality product recommendations
- Create UX template to render the recommended products in the front-end
- Created new API method that would ensure restricted profile data could be safely encrypted and through downstream services to use for display
- Thoroughly test all new changes (unit, integration, performance, comparator tests)
- A/B tested my new recommender to ensure its quality
