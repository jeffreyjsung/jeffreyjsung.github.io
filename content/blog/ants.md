### Summary
This plays essentially exactly the same as the original Plants vs. Zombies tower defense game. The only real differences are that I added some more complex mechanics (EX: minions that don't damage but apply certain status effects), and, of course, visuals. It was good practice using an object-oriented programming paradigm.
